To get Scylla to compile, you need WTL and set it up properly.
WTL can be downloaded from:
http://wtl.sourceforge.net/

Unzip the WTL dir anywhere. Now add the 'Include' path to
Visual Studio's default include directories.
Don't forget to also add it to the Resource includes, otherwise VS
can't find atlres.h when included from .rc files.
